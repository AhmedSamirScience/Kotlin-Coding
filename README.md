<h1>Kotlin KDoc Demonstration</h1>

<p>This repository contains a simple Kotlin application that demonstrates the use of KDoc. KDoc is used to document classes, properties, and member functions in Kotlin, explaining their purpose and any important points.</p>

<h2>Code Overview</h2>

<pre>
<code>
/**
 * Providing KDoc
 * KDoc is used to document classes, properties, and member functions in Kotlin, explaining their purpose and any important points. KDoc comments start with /** and end with */, with each line optionally beginning with an asterisk.
 *
 * By convention, the first paragraph is a summary description, and the following text is a detailed description. IntelliJ can use this summary to provide a popup with more information.
 *
 * Block tags start on a new line with the @ character. Here's an example for the Person class:
 */

/**
 * This is a simple class representing information
 * about a person.
 *
 * @property name the name of this person.
 * @property age the age of this person.
 * @constructor Creates a new person.
 *
 * @author John Hunt
 * @since 1.0
 */
class Person(val name: String = "", var age: Int = 0) {
    override fun toString() = "Person($name, $age)"
}

/**
 * This KDoc provides a clear and structured way to document the Person class and its properties.
 */

fun main() {
    val person = Person("John Doe", 30)
    println(person)
}
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Providing KDoc</h3>

<p>KDoc is used to document classes, properties, and member functions in Kotlin, explaining their purpose and any important points. KDoc comments start with <code>/**</code> and end with <code>*/</code>, with each line optionally beginning with an asterisk.</p>

<p>By convention, the first paragraph is a summary description, and the following text is a detailed description. IntelliJ can use this summary to provide a popup with more information.</p>

<p>Block tags start on a new line with the <code>@</code> character. Here's an example for the <code>Person</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>
/**
 * This is a simple class representing information
 * about a person.
 *
 * @property name the name of this person.
 * @property age the age of this person.
 * @constructor Creates a new person.
 *
 * @author John Hunt
 * @since 1.0
 */
class Person(val name: String = "", var age: Int = 0) {
    override fun toString() = "Person($name, $age)"
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Using KDoc</h3>

<p>The KDoc provides a clear and structured way to document the <code>Person</code> class and its properties. When you hover over the class or its properties in IntelliJ IDEA, you will see a summary of the documentation.</p>

<h3>Example of KDoc in Action</h3>

<pre><code>
fun main() {
    val person = Person("John Doe", 30)
    println(person)
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>KDoc is a powerful tool for documenting your Kotlin code, providing clear and structured information about classes, properties, and functions. This helps improve code readability and maintainability.</p>
